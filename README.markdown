# Frugal - a Colloquy Style

This is the projectpage for Frugal, a style for the  Mac OS X IRC-client  [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info). This project is maintained by [Jeena Paradies](http://github.com/jeena) and [Tobias Tom](http://github.com/tobiastom).

The intention was to create a style for this great IRC-client which is simple, functional but good looking. All other styles couldn't attract us.
